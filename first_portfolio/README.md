# first_portfolio_attempt

A website to display all of the things I learned while in school for web design.
first attempt needs some improvement. Will update.

## Development Notes and things to improve

## Cons

1. I need to make a mobile first responsive design.
2. Maybe do something with black and grey to create sleek looking desingn instead of being so "future-techy" looking.

## Pros

1. I like the "glass case" look for displaying badges.
